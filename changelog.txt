Fury Beta 09
Maintenance/improvement release.

Changes in this version include:
Added CollisionType property to sprites. Allows changing the alignment of a sprite's collision rectangle. (Spherical collision not yet implemented)
Added Preview tab to sprite editor
Added Tile Data to Tilesets
Added Tile Collision to Tilesets
Changed ToString to wrap arrays in () instead of {}
Extended collection support in editor object inspector
Added RelativeRotation property to sprites. If you set both DisplayRotation and this property, image rotation will be used to approximate the difference between poses to give more accurate onscreen rotation.
Changed Collection.Count from a read-only property to a read/write property (Setting it higher adds Nothing items, setting it lower removes items from the end of the collection)
Added attribute filtering to tile picker control (type in an attribute name or part of an attribute name to hide any tiles that lack that attribute)
Changed display resize logic in various editor windows to remove some flicker on certain video driver configurations
Added Fury2Polygon object
Fixed underflow bug in WrapValue/WrapInteger
Added support for polygonal sprite blocking
Added new Compromise library
Implemented Compromise in engine and editor

Improved fury2.exe to auto-run a game if there is a game.f2config in its current folder
Added Game Packer plugin to editor
Added Save Image command to Map Editor's document menu
Added ArrayRotate function
Converted transitions to a generic rendering system

Added SetDefaultTransition command
Added multiple new transitions (wipe {dir}, slide {dir}, smoothwipe {dir} {size})
! Changed Fury2Event parameter ordering. Bound parameters now come AFTER manually passed parameters. If you relied on the old behavior, well, uh. Oops :) !

Fixed a CursorPos related bug in VirtualFile, and added a secondary name for CursorPos (Position)
Replaced Party.Item/Add/Remove/Count with Party.Members (which is a Fury2Collection)
Added Duplicate function to Fury2Collection
Added support for interrupting scripts during execution (useful for stopping an infinite loop)
Made some changes to keyboard accelerator handling
  Characters should not be inserted after you press a hotkey anymore (usually this happened if a hotkey took a while to do its job)
  The editor should no longer 'forget' the state of Control or Shift

Added Ctrl+Pause hotkey for pausing/unpausing games in the editor
Fixed a crash bug in image clip rectangle handling
Fixed clipping-related bugs in gradient routines (none of the gradient routines worked correctly when the target image had a clip rectangle set; this has been fixed at the cost of some performance)
Fixed bug that caused frames not to load their graphics when they were pasted into a pose in the sprite editor
Fixed the camera system so you can add new cameras again (my bad)
Fixed a bug in the Add method of the various collection classes that could cause an add to fail if the index specified was outside the range of the collection

Added the Keyboard object
Added Mouse.Enabled, Keyboard.Enabled, and Joystick.Enabled
Overhauled keyboard input code
Added Video_OpenGL video plugin
Made the map engine faster by fixing an obscenely stupid clipping bug I introduced a while ago (this will be particularly noticable on large maps)

Fixed the Fury2MapLayer.Effect property (oops)
Updated the Basic, Rain, and Menus examples to look correct in OpenGL
Fixed a clipping bug in radial gradients (primarily affected lights in the lighting engine that had EnableCache set to False)
Altered the MaskBlit command to use the mask's Alpha values instead of Red values
Tweaked the Intro example to multiply spark velocity by the screen ratio (basically, this makes it so that the sparks move at about the same speed regardless of resolution - before, the speed depended on the screen resolution the intro was run in)
Changed the setup program's behavior to (hopefully) properly handle systems with newer/older versions of vbscript.dll and/or tlbinf32.dll

Enabled the image cache in the editor (should reduce memory usage and speed up loading of sprites/maps, but may cause changes to image files to not show up immediately)
Changed Fury2Sprites.SpritesFromDistance to take a sprite object instead of an index
Fixed the SpritesFrom* and SpriteFrom* methods of the Map.Sprites object so they act like the Map.Layers(N).Sprites equivalents
Fixed SpritesFromDistance so all the arguments work (oops)
Added Alpha property to light sources
Improved Fury2Font to not import unsupported characters from TTFs

Fixed the DestroyAllTimers command
Changed engine behavior so it will refuse to load if given a bad game path (i.e. nonexistent folder)
Added Paused property to Fury2Slider object
Made engine prompt for a game if you run it without specifying one
Changed configuration window so it says 'Configure {Game Name}' instead of 'Configure Fury2'

Added Playing property to Fury2Video object
Fixed grid color defaulting to transparent (thanks acylein)
Fixed installer not correctly erasing old editor settings (thanks acylein)

Removed long-deprecated values from ResampleMode enumeration and added _Wrap and _Clamp versions of Linear and Bilinear
Implemented mesh deformation blitting

Added F2DeformationMesh function for creating mesh objects
Added optional distortion effect to Reflect example (change the flag at the top of the source code to enable it)

Added PushClipRectangle, PopClipRectangle, and ResetClipRectangleStack to Fury2Image class (so you don't have to do it manually)

Added callback events to Sound and Channel objects (StartEvent, EndEvent, BeforeEndEvent, and StopEvent)
Added PatternMatch function
Tweaked FadeBGM to cancel previous fades of the same BGM when it's called
Fixed bug in StopBGM that caused BGM channels not to stop playing once they had faded out (resulted in excessive CPU usage and weird EndEvent/BeforeEndEvent behavior)

Changed tileset/image flush debug messages so they only appear if an image or tileset was flushed

Additionally, auto-flushing is now less aggressive and should perform less unnecessary flushing of images.)

Added Data tab to sprite editor
Improved multiselect in sprite editor (Blocking and Alignment tabs now fully support multiselect, and the Rectangle tab supports multiselect as long as all frames use the same image)

Added the Sprite Painter tool to the map editor
Changed intro in examples so you can skip it with Esc
Improved Speech Bubble example to demonstrate the new Data tab
Added support for substring coloring to font engine (use the #[RRGGBBAA], #[RRGGBB], #[VVAA] or #[VV] escape sequences to set color, and #[] to restore to default)
Added support for subfonts to font engine (used the ~[name] escape sequence to switch to a subfont, and ~[] escape sequence to switch back to the original font)

Overhauled type library source code to use better syntax
Removed some deprecated functions from SoftFX

Rewrote all the Merge blit routines (they were broken, but it was hard to notice)
Fixed bug that caused pressing Alt+F4 when running a game in the editor to close both the editor AND the game
Changed default for the HarassCPU option to True (this causes the engine to run as fast as possible, instead of the previous behavior of running at 'about 60fps'. Since the option would cause games to run slowly under certain circumstances even if your computer was fast enough to play them, I decided to change the default so people's games will run correctly without needing to set the option manually.)

Added debugging API to engine
Added debugging thunk library
Changed editor to use debugging thunk library to run games instead of running a copy of the engine EXE
Added game debugger
Reworked engine to support multiple instances
